## Play by Wire challenge

https://github.com/Eclipse-SDV-Hackathon-Chapter-Two/challenge-play-by-wire

We aim to develop a game that operates within a structure inspired by current vehicle electronics architecture, utilizing HPCs and computing boards. The game will integrate multiple Eclipse SDV and other open-source projects.


### What to do?

* Check whats delivered with the challenge
* Identify useful eclipse projects
* Design an architecture
* Get the needed HW components
* Understand the Eclipse SDV projects
* -> get it running ;)
